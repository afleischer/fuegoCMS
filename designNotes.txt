Idea: Have "App" be the whole page.

Question 1: Is a WYSIWYG unrealistic?
	 An alternative design: have a page with:
	    -Ability to Add text to a "CMS Item"
	    -Add the "CMS Item" to a page

	    -Styling can be later, just get it to work now
	    	     Which means that I should focus on 

Design of components within the App:

VisualEdit:
	--iFrame tool pointing to a page
	--


?? Should I use iFrame for visual editor ??
