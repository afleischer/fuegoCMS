Anywhere in my project, I want to be able to:

--Get a list of unique keys to reference, given a path :: ./components/functions/getKeys.js
--Loop through those keys




Architecture questions:
0. What is the primary purpose of the app and what is my scope?
Purpose:
--Demonstrate React + Firebase skills
--Make a tool that allows users to easily

Value add over webflow:
-FOSS
-Very easy to export code.
-Import code?????  __What about nested code????__ 

What value would I provide to content creators over what I currently do? 
--Make a tool that can easily store 
--Create tool to generate 

Out of scope: Webflow look-alike.  The amount of features present would take _Way_ too much time. 



1. To what extent should I allow the user to add styling?  Should I allow the user to set any style they want?
--Is there an online list of possible styles???


The easiest option would be to select an element, which will emit a notice as to which element is being selected.  This notice will be picked up by the styleContent section which will highlight a field that lists its properties.  I can edit these properties


2. How do I handle nested HTML tags?
Option 1: Placement: if decimal spotted, will be inserted before next parent element.
Problem-> Multi-nested elements. Can add more periods if needed, but

ex:

<div> 1.0
	<h1> 1.1  <b>1.1.1 </b></h1>
	<div>1.2
	<p>1.2.1 </p>
	</div>

</div>

Problem -> Placing the closing tags after all the constituent tags have rendered.
ex: <div> 1 <p>1.1 </p> </div> <--Close the tag here, AFTER 1.1
Solution -> Check 


in generateHTMLTag(){

   

in Firebase

tags:
	<<key>>
		content
		placement
		tag_type
		attributes
